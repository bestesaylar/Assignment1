        <p>My name is Beste and I am excited to meet you!
            I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey where I had my bachelor degree in Business Administration, before
            relocating to New York to pursue my master’s degree <mark>at NYU’s Interactive</mark> Telecommunications Program.
            Coming from one cultural melting pot to another, I value <mark>experiences that</mark> broaden <mark>my</mark> horizons and allow me to
            develop myself both as an artist and a technologist. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new tools and
            techniques to bring my ideas to life, and I take pride in my ability to accelerate my learning curve and problem
            solve on-the-fly. I am self-disciplined when I work alone, also I thrive in collaborative work environments, that is
            why I have <mark>collaborated</mark> with many professionals who have diverse set of skills and backgrounds. A lot of my
            work is inspired by <mark>human centered</mark> portraiture, self awareness, perception and playfulness. I have various
            technical skills including numerous <mark>programming</mark> languages such as <mark>Javascript, C/C++</mark>, node.js, CSS, physical
            computing, circuit design and computer vision tools.
            My interests include <mark>creative coding</mark>, <mark>interactive</mark> installations, playing with and exploring new technology and
            learning new tools and platforms. <mark>I am looking forward</mark> to dedicate my skills as a hard working and highly
            motivated <mark>multidisciplinary</mark> artist/<mark>technologist.</mark>
        <mark>After reviewing my</mark> resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you
    <mark>are looking for. I look forward</mark> to elaborating on how my specific skills and abilities will benefit your organization.
            Please <mark>contact me at (917)442-7033 or</mark> via email at bs4073@nyu.edu to arrange for a convenient meeting time.</p>
