        <h1>Welcome to my Homepage</h1>
        <p>My name is Beste and I am excited to meet you!
            I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey where I had my bachelor degree in Business Administration, before
            relocating to New York to pursue my master’s degree at NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program.
            Coming from one cultural melting pot to another, I value experiences that broaden my horizons and allow me to
            develop myself both as an artist and a technologist. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new tools and
            techniques to bring my ideas to life, and I take pride in my ability to accelerate my learning curve and problem
            solve on-the-fly. I am self-disciplined when I work alone, also I thrive in collaborative work environments, that is
            why I have collaborated with many professionals who have diverse set of skills and backgrounds. A lot of my
            work is inspired by human centered portraiture, self awareness, perception and playfulness. I have various
            technical skills including numerous programming languages such as Javascript, C/C++, node.js, CSS, physical
            computing, circuit design and computer vision tools.
            My interests include creative coding, interactive installations, playing with and exploring new technology and
            learning new tools and platforms. I am looking forward to dedicate my skills as a hard working and highly
            motivated multidisciplinary artist/technologist.
            After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you
            are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills and abilities will benefit your organization.
            Please contact me at (917)442-7033 or via email at bs4073@nyu.edu to arrange for a convenient meeting time.<p>
